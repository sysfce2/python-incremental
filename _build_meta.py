"""
Comply with PEP 517's restictions on in-tree backends.

We use setuptools to package Incremental, but also want to use
Incremental to manage its own version. To do this we specify
``backend-path`` in our ``pyproject.toml``, but PEP 517 requires
that when ``backend-path`` is specified:

> The backend code MUST be loaded from one of the directories
> specified in backend-path (i.e., it is not permitted to
> specify backend-path and not have in-tree backend code).

We comply by re-publishing setuptools' build_meta.
